    <h2>About us</h2>
    <section class="flow">
      <p>While bike polo have been around in Austin since 2008, ATXBPSC officially formed 2009 and for most of that time has called Mendez Park* home. Since our beginning, we have worked hard to create a diverse, inclusive, and supportive space.</p>
      <p>We are inclusive, mixed-gender, pro-LGBTQ, antiracist, open to all ages and abilities. We do not tolerate hate speech or disrespectful behaviour.</p>
      <p><small>* Mendez Park used to be called Metz Park. It was originally named after a confederate soldier (gross). In 2020, the park was renamed after <a href="https://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/arts/2019-05-07/in-memoriam-rodolfo-mendez/">Rodolfo "Rudy" Mendez</a>, a dance teacher and mentor in East Austin!</small></p>

      <h3>Rookie Nights</h3>
      <p><em>Tuesdays, 7-10pm</em></p>
      <p>Our Rookie Nights are specifically for anyone who considers themselves a rookie or who has never played before. This is the easiest way to learn what bike polo is and how to play. We'll teach you everything you've ever wanted to know about bike polo. The only things we ask you to bring are a bike and a helmet, we'll provide everything else!</p>
      <br>
      <h3>Pickup Nights*</h3>
      <p><em>Thursdays, 7-10pm</em></p>
      <p>These are the nights where the entire club comes together for some fun 3v3 bike polo! We typically will throw all the mallets in a pile and then shuffle at random. Games are usually around 12-15 minutes each depending on how many people show up.</p>
      <p>Even though we have "Rookie Nights" on Tuesdays, anyone is still welcome to join our weekly pickup nights, even beginners. Some games can be fast-paced, but if you're new, we'll slow it down and make sure to give you some good passes! You're also welcome to just watch and hang.</p>
      <p><small>*There may be newer groups who play bike polo in Austin, but this our official night where the Code of Conduct is reinforced.</small></p>
      <br>
      <h3>TFW-GNC Nights</h3>
      <p><em>TBD - not currently in session</em></p>
      <p>Throughout the year we will host nights specifically for WTF-NB* players. We wanted to create a safe space for folks who might feel most comfortable in a setting like this. This is for all skill levels, but don't feel intimidated if you're new. Our more seasoned players will make sure you are part of the game and help you get better! We respectfully ask all cis, male players to take the night off.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for when we get started up again!</p>
      <p><small>* TFW-GNC stands for Trans, Femme, Women, and Gender Non-Comforming folks, and hope it includes everyone in our community.</small></p>

    <h2>What is bike polo?</h2>
    <section class="flow">
      <p>Bike polo is a mixed-gender sport played on bikes that's like hockey on bikes. It started in the 1890s on grass. Back in the late 90s, some bored bike messengers started playing in a parking garage in Seattle. This is the version we play, hardcourt bike polo. There are 2 goals, a ball, and 6 players on a court (3v3). Put the ball in the goal. Pretty simple.</p>
      <p>Here are some very basic rules:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>BE RESPECTFUL</li>
        <li>In order to score, you have to hit the ball with the end of the mallet into the goal. You can't use the side, called a shuffle.</li>
        <li>If you put your foot down, you must tap your mallet on the boards at halfcourt (on either side).</li>
        <li>"Like contact" is allowed (bike-on-bike, shoulder-to-shoulder, mallet-to-mallet), unless it's excessive. We tend to avoid much contact and save it for tournaments.</li>
      </ol>
